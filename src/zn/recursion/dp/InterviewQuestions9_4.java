     * TODO this problem is typical, and there's lots of detail I need to review it!!!!
     * transform this type of problem to how to traverse binary tree
     * given a array: x1, x2, x3, x4, find all subset of this array(must be unique)
     * each element has two choices: 0 (choose); 1(don't choose) (the scale of this problem is 2^n (multiplication principle))
     * so we could build binary tree depending on above:
     * 0 left path; 1 right path; tree depth(total length of path): n; (from root to leaf, each path which length n represent a subset)
     * NOTE: we use DFS instead of preOrder, cause iterative solution stack element cannot correspond the trace of path
     * NOTE: so we use stack to mimic DFS, stack's poping-pushing process contain the meaning: each time when we get 1, mean 1's brother path already been traversed, so we should backtrack
     * NOTEï¼šBinary Tree traverse: preOrder's iterative solution != DFS's iterative solution(diff in element in stack, dfs's stack can store a path)
     * NOTE: Binary Tree traverse: preOrder's recursive solution != DFS's recursive solution
     * depth i being 0 means we don't choose array[i], and vice versa;
     * we use stack to traverse this tree, and use ArrayList to print the subset;
